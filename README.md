# Trainless Neural Architecture Search

Here one can find the code reproducing our results on trainless NAS.
This code is a modified version of the code provided by @jack-willturner.
The original code can be found at https://github.com/BayesWatch/nas-without-training.

The modifications are nothing but the change of the metric and it's implementation.
